# Default filters

The search API applies a couple of filters by default to provide you with the most relevant results for most use cases:

* [**workflowStatus**](../searching/workflow-status.md): Only results with the status `APPROVED` or `READY_FOR_VALIDATION` will be returned by default.
* [**availability**](../searching/availability.md): Only results that are currently available will be returned by default.
* [**addressCountry**](../searching/address.md): Only results that are in Belgium are returned by default.
* [**audienceType**](../searching/audience-type.md): Only results that have an `audienceType` set to `everyone` are returned by default.

You can either reset these filters individually, or disable them all at once.
