# Case sensitivity

Unless noted otherwise, all search functionality is case-insensitive.

This also goes for fields that look for "exact" matches, such as IDs and labels.

For example, when searching for the uuid `2327d4d9-f0a8-4c81-abd6-5bfa87dff1dd`, you will still get results even if the uuid actually is  `2327D4D9-F0A8-4C81-ABD6-5BFA87DFF1DD`.

In the case of labels, `UiTPAS` \(for example\) is considered to be the same as `uitpas`, and vice versa.
